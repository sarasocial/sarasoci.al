## sara is:
- silly internet girl
- nonbinary transsexual woman
- doing cs & english
- has never, ever been caught
- should **not** be online. please tell her to log off!
- gayyyyy

## what is this?

my website! she's nothing special and a work in progress, but she gets the job done and i like her. i made her myself in [eleventy](https://11ty.dev). there isn't much to see, but if you're interested you can take a gander at the [repo](https://github.com/sarasocial/sarasocial.github.io) :)

this page is very temporary btw. i'll be making it better when i can *(ps sorry the font and theming are kinda ugly right now)*

## why does this exist?

my goal for this site is to build a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) that houses things that i create, and leads to things that i enjoy. right now, though, there's neither content nor a content management system. but i'm working on it!

keeping it so real though right now this site is a glorified linktree with two links. fuck you

## where else are you?

~~speaking of links right now you can find me on...~~ THEY'RE IN THE FOOTER NOW!!!! i made a footer, my links are there :)

i'll add more links over time. need to set up a bsky pds and also get a matrix lol

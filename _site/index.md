## sara is:
- silly internet girl
- nonbinary transsexual woman
- doing cs & english
- has never, ever been caught
- should **not** be online. please tell her to log off!
- gayyyyy

and that's about it!

## what is this?

my website! she's nothing special, but she gets the job done and i made her myself in [eleventy](https://11ty.dev). there isn't much to see but you can take a gander at the repo [here](https://github.com/sarasocial/sarasocial.github.io) if you'd like :)

at some point i'll add more cool things. like maybe some [88x31](https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/) buttons that take you to dead links or something. that sounds cool

## why does this exist

at *some point* i'd like to host various writings and projects here. i'm very into the idea of [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), although the common definition is a bit restrictive. ideally, this space would be some sort of cross between a blog, a gallery, and that.

*however!* for now this site is a glorified linktree. with two links. fuck you

## where else are you?

speaking of links right now you can find me on [github](https://github.com/sarasocial), [hexbear](https://hexbear.net/u/sara), and discord if we're friendly. at some point soon (once i get off my ass and set up pds stuff), [this link](https://bsky.app/profile/sarasoci.al) will take you to a bsky profile.

i'll put some more up later lol

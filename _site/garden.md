oh my goodness, a garden!

## what is a digital garden?

it's a **digital garden** of sorts. maggie appleton has written a [wonderful introduction/history](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) on them. she describes them as:

> "*[...]* a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing."

her whole piece is a wonderful starting point. ~~i've also written~~ i'm also working on writing my own thoughts on them; [the beauty of digital gardens](/beauty-of-gardens/), and [why i prefer them](/why-digital-gardens/) over other formats like *blogs* and *portfolios*.

to provide a short definition of my own:

> **digital gardens** are online spaces where things *(thoughts, journal entries, essays, poems, projects, etc.)* can live and grow among eachother. they are characterized by *interconnectedness*, [change](on-change), a hint of *chaos*, and *[variation](/on-variety/)*.

> everything in the garden is connected through a sprawling maze of links *(often hypertext)*, leading from page to page, idea to idea. these links act as a natural path for traversing the garden and its overgrowth.

so, now you know! if any of the little hypertext links above interest you, feel free to click on them and see what you find. have fun :)

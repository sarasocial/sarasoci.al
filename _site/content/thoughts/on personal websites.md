> ***the internet fucking sucks.***

it's actually crazy how bad the state of the internet is.

there's like 10 companies *(or less!)* that control everybody's online identities. the average person's digital presence probably consists of a *facebook/instagram*, a ~~*twitter*~~ fuck you, maybe a *linkedin* or a *youtube* or something and a couple other socials.

they have an email address that's probably owned by google, who also owns youtube and likely the browser they use (or the software it uses!) as well. if they game, they probably have a *discord* and a *steam* account, maybe an *xbox* or *playstation* account as well.

> *relevant: [fuck google](https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/quitting-google)*

now, apart from probably collecting your information and selling it illegaly, and having monopolies that our shitty governments refuse to break apart, what do all of these services have in common?

> ***no ownership, no control.***

fuck all of this! there is no ownership, anywhere, of what you do on the internet.

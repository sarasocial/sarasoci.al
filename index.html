<h2>sara is:</h2>
<ul>
<li>silly internet girl</li>
<li>nonbinary transsexual woman</li>
<li>doing cs &amp; english</li>
<li>has never, ever been caught</li>
<li>should <strong>not</strong> be online. please tell her to log off!</li>
<li>gayyyyy</li>
</ul>
<p>and that's about it!</p>
<h2>what is this?</h2>
<p>my website! she's nothing special, but she gets the job done and i made her myself in <a href="https://11ty.dev">eleventy</a>. there isn't much to see but you can take a gander at the repo <a href="https://github.com/sarasocial/sarasocial.github.io">here</a> if you'd like :)</p>
<p>at some point i'll add more cool things. like maybe some <a href="https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/">88x31</a> buttons that take you to dead links or something. that sounds cool</p>
<h2>why does this exist</h2>
<p>at <em>some point</em> i'd like to host various writings and projects here. i'm very into the idea of <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital gardens</a>, although the common definition is a bit restrictive. ideally, this space would be some sort of cross between a blog, a gallery, and that.</p>
<p><em>however!</em> for now this site is a glorified linktree. with two links. fuck you</p>
<h2>where else are you?</h2>
<p>speaking of links right now you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/sarasocial">github</a>, <a href="https://hexbear.net/u/sara">hexbear</a>, and discord if we're friendly. at some point soon (once i get off my ass and set up pds stuff), <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sarasoci.al">this link</a> will take you to a bsky profile.</p>
<p>i'll put some more up later lol</p>

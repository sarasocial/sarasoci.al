## sara is:
- silly internet girl
- nonbinary transsexual woman
- doing cs & english
- has never, ever been caught
- should **not** be online. please tell her to log off!
- gayyyyy

## what is this?

my website! she's nothing special and a work in progress, but she gets the job done and i like her. i made her myself in [eleventy](https://11ty.dev). if you're interested you can take a gander at the [repo](https://github.com/sarasocial/sarasocial.github.io) :)

## why does this exist?

my goal for this site is to build a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) that houses things that i create, and leads to things that i enjoy. there's neither content nor a content management system yet, but i'm working on it!

i've also been working on some [dotfiles](https://github.com/sarasocial/dotfiles) which you can *(in the future, in theory)* install by running the following command:

`curl -L sarasoci.al/dots.sh`

the repo is pretty much empty right now (i'm not even storing my shit there yet lol), but hopefully that'll change soon--and once it does, i'll probably set up some dedicated pages for them here.


## where else are you?

here and there! my links are in the footer :)

i'm primarily on [bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:web:sarasoci.al). if you wanna reach out, @ing me there is the best way to do it. my account is stored on a [pds](https://pds.sarasoci.al) currently hosted on a [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet for like $5/mo, highly recommend if you're interested in starting your own!

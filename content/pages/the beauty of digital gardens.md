sometime in 2024, a [friend](https://bsky.app/profile/raantuva.fyi) and i were talking about how we both wanted spaces of our own to share ideas online. during that, ae introduced me to [bearblog](https://bearblog.dev). i scrolled through their discover page and stumbled across a post from [ava](https://blog.avas.space/), which led me to [her garden](https://blog.avas.space/garden/), and then to [maggie appleton's write-up](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). i was hooked.

> *"holy shit. you can do that???"*

there's something so beautiful about digital gardens. the more time i spend with them *(both tending my own and exploring [others](/other-gardens/))*, the more i feel it.

digital gardens. the monotony of blogs and portfolios. they're fresh. full of ideas and creations and things to **discover**. with blogs, you scroll; with digital gardens, you explore. they have [variation](/variation/), soul, character; they are cohesively *alive* in a way that the rest of the [modern web](https://yesterweb.org/no-to-web3/) isn't. like oases of spirit in a world wide desert so stubbornly, persistently devoid of it.

anyways, digital gardens are awesome and you should make one if you like them. check out quarts by jacky zhao and this compilation of resources maintained by maggie appleton.

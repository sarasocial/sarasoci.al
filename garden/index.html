<p>oh my goodness, a garden!</p>
<h2>what is a digital garden?</h2>
<p>it's a <strong>digital garden</strong> of sorts. maggie appleton has written a <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">wonderful introduction/history</a> on them. she describes them as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>[...]</em> a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>her whole piece is a wonderful starting point. <s>i've also written</s> i'm also working on writing my own thoughts on them; <a href="/beauty-of-gardens/">the beauty of digital gardens</a>, and <a href="/why-digital-gardens/">why i prefer them</a> over other formats like <em>blogs</em> and <em>portfolios</em>.</p>
<p>to provide a short definition of my own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>digital gardens</strong> are online spaces where things <em>(thoughts, journal entries, essays, poems, projects, etc.)</em> can live and grow among eachother. they are characterized by <em>interconnectedness</em>, <a href="on-change">change</a>, a hint of <em>chaos</em>, and <em><a href="/on-variety/">variation</a></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>everything in the garden is connected through a sprawling maze of links <em>(often hypertext)</em>, leading from page to page, idea to idea. these links act as a natural path for traversing the garden and its overgrowth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so, now you know! if any of the little hypertext links above interest you, feel free to click on them and see what you find. have fun :)</p>
